# DDPWeek4Assignment
Week4 Assignment for Developing Data Products on Coursera

For the UI and SERVER code please refer to the app.R file hosted within this repo.

The live app itself is located here:
https://krecursive.shinyapps.io/DDP_Week4Assignment/

I couldn't find any example or methods of what "supporting documentation" would be so I tried to be extra clear with the text descriptions within the app itself (e.g., describing the input fields, etc.).



For the presentation code please refer to the pitch.md, pitch.Rpres, and pitch-rpubs.html files hosted within this repo.

The presentation is located here:
