# DDPWeek4Assignment
Week4 Assignment for Developing Data Products on Coursera

For the UI and SERVER code please refer to the app.R file.

The app itself is located here:
https://krecursive.shinyapps.io/DDP_Week4Assignment/

I couldn't find any example or methods of what "supporting documentation" would be so I tried to be extra clear with the text descriptions within the app itself (e.g., describing the input fields, etc.).
